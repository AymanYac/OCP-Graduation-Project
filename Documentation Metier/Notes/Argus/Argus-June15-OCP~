*********PRODUCT_DEV
Amonium phosphates will keep dominating
	*Demand for modified amm ph			=> best placed people are those with access to low-cost Nitrogen
	*more amm ph will be converted to nutrients 	=>
Globally,No surge of growth in STP NPH &locally in countries defficient in rock quality.

CAGR +1.6% over the +15 y

diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate will not disappear, but the market may increasingly perceive them as raw materials or intermediates in the production of end-fertilizers;
Traded volumes of all other phosphate products — superphosphates,
merchant acid and chemically combined NPKs — are either static or in
decline;
The major swing factors in the global ammonium phosphate trade will
remain India’s import appetite and China’s export capabilities;
observed increase in the volume of merchant rock sold >>
- Growth of the oil palm sector in southeast Asia;
- The availability of low-cost rock from Egypt and other smaller
suppliers;
- The need to reduce the cost of nutrients.
