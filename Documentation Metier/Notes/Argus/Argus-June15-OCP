Amonium phosphates will keep dominating
	*Demand for modified amm ph			=> best placed people are those with access to low-cost Nitrogen
	*more amm ph will be converted to nutrients 	=>
Globally,No surge of growth in STP NPH &locally in countries defficient in rock quality.

diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate will not disappear, but the market may increasingly perceive them as raw materials or intermediates in the production of end-fertilizers;
Traded volumes of all other phosphate products — superphosphates,
merchant acid and chemically combined NPKs — are either static or in
decline;
The major swing factors in the global ammonium phosphate trade will
remain India’s import appetite and China’s export capabilities;
observed increase in the volume of merchant rock sold >>
- Growth of the oil palm sector in southeast Asia;
- The availability of low-cost rock from Egypt and other smaller
suppliers;
- The need to reduce the cost of nutrients.
------------------------------------------------
The base view of this analysis is that there has been a long-term shift in
diammonium phosphate production costs and pricing, associated with anupward
shift in sulphur and ammonia price fundamentals. Added to this is
OCP’s ability to exercise a degree of market control and earn an associated
margin on its sales of diammonium phosphate and other phosphate
products. This margin will fluctuate with general market conditions in the
course of the normal cycle and the long-term market control margin on
diammonium phosphate is assumed to be $180/t;
